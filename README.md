Amazon Test Automation
Project Overview
This project involves the creation of test automation scenarios for the Amazon website. The goal is to automate common user interactions such as logging in, searching for items, sorting products, and adding items to the cart. The automation was built using Selenium, Java, JUnit, and Cucumber BDD to ensure the web application functions as expected under various conditions.

Technologies Used
Selenium: A powerful tool for controlling a web browser through the program. It is used for web-based automation.
Java: The programming language used to write the automation scripts.
JUnit: A widely-used testing framework for Java that allows for the creation of test cases and assertions.
Cucumber BDD: A tool for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) that helps write tests in a readable and understandable format for non-developers.

Search Functionality: Automates searching for products on the Amazon website to verify the search feature.
Sorting: Automates sorting of products based on different criteria like price, ratings, etc.
